Active accounts continue to grow, but user acquisition has plateaued, shifting growth toward existing users. Revenue now drives a significant share of Safaricom’s total, though incremental gains are slowing as the platform matures. Transaction volume rises steadily, while average transaction value declines, reflecting a clear shift toward micro-payments. Merchant-led payments have overtaken cash agents, with Pochi emerging as the fastest-growing channel, now driving the majority of micro-commerce flows.\n\n**Business Task:** Understand M-Pesa’s evolution in users, revenue, and transactions, identify ecosystem shifts, and pinpoint monetization opportunities.\n\n**Dataset Source & Limitations:** Data comes from Safaricom annual reports (2015–2025) and includes active accounts, agent, merchant, and Pochi counts, total transactions and values, and revenue. Analysis is limited to Kenya, uses annual aggregates, and may be affected by missing fields or unverified company-reported figures.
